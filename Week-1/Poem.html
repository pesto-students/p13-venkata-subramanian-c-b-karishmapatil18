            I'm Nobody! Who are you? <br>
            Are you - Nobody - Too?<br>
            Then there's a pair of us!
        </p>

        
        <p>
            Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!<br>
            How dreary - to be - Somebody!<br>
            How public - like a Frog -<br>
            To tell one's name - the livelong June - To an admiring Bog!
